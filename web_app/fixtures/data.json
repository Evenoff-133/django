He explains that Lüderitz's location is ideal, because of the extensive solar and wind resources and the proximity to the ocean, both as a water source and a port.<p><p>Mr Mnyupe says this is all part of a plan for change in Namibia by President Hage Geingob. \"The president was very keen to craft an economic recovery plan that is responsive, globally relevant, and systemic in nature.\"<p><p>This forms part of a much bigger development fuelled by green hydrogen that the government hopes to find funding for, expanding into agriculture, logistics and energy. Mr Mnyupe speaks of green hydrogen trains and pipelines to trade with neighbouring countries.<p><p>There are hopes of creating renewable electricity, both for export and as an alternative to imported coal power from South Africa.<p><p>\"The idea is to turn Namibia into not just a green hydrogen hub, but into a synthetic fuels industry powerhouse,\" he says.<p><p>The impact is set to be international, with agreements already signed with Germany, Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands.<p><p>This comes with some funding agreements, but Namibia is looking at more options, such as green or sustainable bonds, towards the roughly $9.4bn (£7.1bn) needed for the initial project.<p><p>To put the size of the investment into perspective - Namibia's entire GDP in 2020 was just $10.7bn.<p><p>\"People could start taking us seriously as a trading partner, and not a net recipient of development assistance,\" says Mr Mnyupe. \"For the ordinary Namibian, this means hope.\"<p><p>More technology of business:<p><p>Mr Balhoa expects that the planned influx of people and business will strengthen infrastructure in Lüderitz, like roads and hospitals, and that the project will attract more investment from the central government into the area.<p><p>But the optimism comes with matching concerns. Mr Balhoa says previous large projects have not invested back into the community as hoped. The are worries that the small town will not be able to meet the increased infrastructure demands - with accessible housing already being a big challenge.<p><p>\"I do believe it's going to be a game changer, not just for Namibia, but for the African continent,\" says Kennedy Chege, a researcher and PhD candidate at the Mineral Law in Africa research chair, University of Cape Town.<p><p>But he warns that the main challenges is financing: \"Trying to develop renewable energy plans normally requires so much funding, and the government itself is not able to actually provide that funding through its budget. So it requires mobilizing funding from both the public sector and the private sectors.\"<p><p>Mr Chege says Namibia's international partnerships are a positive sign.<p><p>Another challenge is the amount of water that is required to produce hydrogen. Doing this through desalination, as Namibia plans to, can be expensive - as are the electrolysis processes used later in the hydrogen-making process.<p><p>Mr Chege says concerns about the viability of the project and creating the kind of infrastructure needed are valid, but he is hopeful given Namibia's comparative advantages.<p><p>While several countries in Africa, like South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria are developing green hydrogen plans, Namibia is the more advanced. \"But in terms of implementation, there hasn't been much progress in that regard, throughout Africa.\"<p><p>While there is much to be done, Namibia is pushing ahead - so much so, that the government might announce a call for proposals for a second green hydrogen project as early as January 2022.<p>", "content_words_count": null, "short_description": "By Elna Schutz\nJohannesburg, South Africa \"So now finally, we're on the map,\" says Philip Balhoa about Lüderitz, a town in southern Namibia, where harsh desert meets pale ocean.

It showed the double-headed eagle of the Russian coat of arms, with the bird's heads replaced by faces of President Vladimir Putin and the then-prime minister, Dmitri Medvedev.<p><p>Alongside it was a short poem, alleging that the eagle was twice as greedy as others, lied twice as much and carried out surveillance with four eyes. It ended with an emotional cry: \"When will Russians awaken to remove this contagion?\"<p><p>The Russian government told Facebook to remove the post because of its \"blatant disrespect towards the state, the constitution and the president of the Russian Federation\". Facebook did not comply, and the post featured in one of more than 60 lawsuits launched against Western social media in Russia this year, resulting in fines of more than $2m.<p><p>It's not clear how many of the fines have actually been paid. But the cases highlight the difficulty of operating in a country where restrictions are placed on freedom of speech and political activity - most notably the ruling in June this year that the Anti-Corruption Foundation headed by jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny is an \"extremist\" organisation, on a par with the Taliban or the Islamic State group.<p><p>According to the head of media regulator Roskomnadzor, Andrei Lipov, social media companies are obliged to find and remove \"the most dangerous things\", which he listed in an interview with the Kommersant newspaper as \"child pornography, suicide, drugs, extremism and fake news\".<p><p>But a close examination of the roughly 400 posts listed in court proceedings against Google, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter reveals that just nine concern child abuse or drugs, and only 12 refer to suicide. The overwhelming majority are calls to attend pro-Navalny demonstrations.<p><p>If the graph does not load, try using a different browser<p><p>\"Neither Roskomnadzor nor the Kremlin wants to say that Russia has political censorship,\" says Sarkis Darbinian, a legal expert at freedom-of-speech pressure group Roskomsvoboda. Commenting on the emphasis placed on child protection in official statements, he says: \"To explain to the broad masses why this struggle is necessary, they exploit the tears of a child.\"<p><p>Roskomnadzor, the media regulator, didn't respond to the BBC's request for comment, but President Putin's press spokesman has previously said that actions taken against social media companies are not censorship, but simply attempts to enforce Russian law.<p><p>Pressure on social media companies dates back to 2015, when a law came into force obliging them to store the personal data of Russian users on Russian territory and giving the government the power to fine them, or close them down, for not doing so. None of the Western companies have complied, which led to the closure of LinkedIn in 2016. Google, Meta and Twitter have collectively been fined more than $600,000 since the start of 2020.<p><p>It was in 2016 that requests from the Russian government to Google to remove videos from YouTube and to block certain search results began to rapidly increase. The company's transparency reports show that over the last 10 years it has received more such requests from Russia than the rest of the world combined - Google says a third of them relate to \"national security\".<p><p>If the graph does not load, try using a different browser<p><p>Like the other Western companies, Google complies with some Russian requests but not with others.<p><p>Efforts to control the spread of undesirable information on social media accelerated further in early 2021, after the return of Alexei Navalny to Russia from hospital in Germany, where he had been treated for poisoning with the chemical weapon Novichok.<p><p>Navalny was immediately arrested, leading to unsanctioned protests in Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities, which supporters widely advertised on social media.<p><p>This prompted angry complaints from Roskomnadzor. The posts were quickly removed from the third most popular social network in Russia, VKontakte (or VK.com), owned at that point by oligarch Alisher Usmanov, the former Arsenal football club shareholder.<p><p>But Western social networks were less accommodating, so Roskomnadzor started taking them to court and fining them.<p><p>Its next step, in March, was to slow down traffic on Twitter, for its refusal to delete these and other posts. Pictures and videos, in particular, became slower to load.<p><p>If the graph does not load, try using a different browser<p><p>And later in the year it persuaded Google and Apple to remove from their stores a tactical voting app, designed to help Navalny sympathisers unite behind a single candidate in local elections, thereby maximising the chance of defeating the candidate of the ruling United Russia party.<p><p>The head of Navalny's team, Ivan Zhdanov, denounced the companies for what he described as \"a shameful act of political censorship\".<p><p>He later tweeted part of a letter from Apple, which pointed out that prosecutors had said the app was enabling illegal \"interference in elections\" and that media regulator Roskomnadzor had warned the company that it was promoting an \"extremist organisation\".<p><p>The BBC asked to interview Apple, Google, Meta and Twitter, but Google and Twitter declined to comment, and Apple and Meta didn't respond.<p><p>Roskomnadzor claims some success in getting posts deleted, as well as the voting app.<p><p>In May it partially reversed the action taken to slow down Twitter, claiming that the company had deleted 91% of a list of 5,900 tweets. Now it's only on mobile internet devices that pictures and videos on Twitter continue to load slowly.<p><p>Tweets that Twitter deletes after being fined for refusing to do so are generally only deleted for Russian users - they nearly always remain visible to users outside the country.<p><p>One of the tweets mentioned in court documents was a quote-tweet sent in January by a young activist called Alexei, relaying information about a pro-Navalny protest planned for the following Saturday in Nizhny Novgorod - a city on the Volga River, east of Moscow.<p><p>As the city's authorities hadn't approved the demonstration, Alexei chose his words carefully, describing the location as \"the place you mustn't go\". He added, \"Putin really doesn't want you to go there, so don't!\"<p><p>But the irony wasn't enough to stop Roskomnadzor taking Twitter to court, and Twitter eventually deleted the tweet.<p><p>Now, for Russian users, this tweet has been replaced by a message in English explaining that the message \"has been withheld in Russia in response to a legal demand.\"<p><p>Elsewhere in the world, the tweet still appears as normal.<p><p>Alexei says he hadn't been informed that his tweet was being withdrawn, and only realised when he was contacted by the BBC. He expressed surprise that the original tweet about the protest - the one he retweeted - was still visible.<p><p>By contrast Alexander, a political activist in the town of Kostroma, north-west of Moscow, did get a message when his tweet about a Navalny protest was removed. His VK.com post on the same subject also vanished, but although Facebook contacted him to say the authorities had complained about his post on that network, ultimately they didn't remove it.<p><p>If the graph does not load, try using a different browser<p><p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, does delete some content, though.<p><p>In the first half of 2021, it removed 1,800 pieces of content on Facebook or Instagram, at the request of Russian authorities. In its transparency report the company categorised half of these as \"items related to extremism\". It didn't say how many times it had refused the government's requests.<p><p>Google's transparency report also notes that it has deleted content - either search results, or YouTube videos - following objections from the Russian authorities. However it now complies with more of these requests than in the past. Only 8% were rejected in the first half of 2021, down from 50% in the same period of 2019.<p><p>Russia has the technical means to block the operations of the social media companies, and laws that could provide a justification.<p><p>They can be legally blocked for not storing the personal data of Russian users in Russia, or for refusing to delete harmful content - and from next year it will be possible to block them for not having an office in the country. So far only Google has one (though the company describes it as a \"legal entity\" rather than an office).<p><p>YouTube is currently being threatened with being blocked in return for shutting down channels used by the Kremlin-funded RT news outlet in Germany.<p><p>However at the end of last year, Russia also introduced new higher penalties for failure to delete illegal content, and in court cases due to take place on 24 December both Google and Meta face a possible fine of up to 10% of their annual revenue in Russia.<p><p>\"This motivates the platforms,\" Roskomnadzor boss Andrei Lipov told Kommersant. \"We haven't yet resorted to these fines, but we will.\"<p><p>Meta has not disclosed its Russian revenue, but Google's last year was at least $1bn, opening the way to a possible fine of $100m in its case.<p><p>A former Roskomnadzor official, who asked not to be named, told the BBC these new fines enable the Russian authorities to hit the Western companies where it hurts. And he says he is sure they will.<p><p>Correction 21st December: An earlier version of this article reported that the BBC team had examined more than 600 posts listed in court proceedings against Google, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Again, that's a no.<p><p>\"It costs around $20bn to build a new chip factory,\" says Alan Priestley.<p><p>There's also a massive cost in developing the technology involved in the process, as the industry keeps moving forward.<p><p>If you've tried to order anything from abroad in the last year, you might also be experiencing a problem in the global supply chain.<p><p>That's the journey your console makes from nuts and bolts in a factory on the other side of the world, to your front room.<p><p>In the UK we've seen shortages of HGV drivers to deliver items, but these problems aren't unique to this country.<p><p>In China, the government have limited power consumption, forcing industries to shut down - having a knock-on affect.<p><p>There have also been shortages in the products that assemble chips - everything from \"bits of bent metal\" used to make a console to the cables needed to give it power.<p><p>Nearly all of the retailers Newsbeat approached acknowledged \"the global chip shortage\" had affected business.<p><p>Microsoft's Xbox team told us they are \"working as fast as possible to expedite production and shipping to keep up with unprecedented demand\".<p><p>Currys told Newsbeat \"our suppliers are affected by the microchip shortage\" and John Lewis said they were \"continuing to work with suppliers in reposes to global challenges on consoles\".<p><p>Others have gone further, saying they're struggling to supply enough consoles.<p><p>The advice from all: Keep checking back regularly for stock.<p><p>The question we're all asking is: When will I actually be able to buy a console?<p><p>According to Alan Priestley, during the second half of next year \"we should start to see normality returning\".<p><p>\"Things are getting better all of the time.

Meanwhile, some electronics firms shut production lines that were only marginally profitable.<p><p>But at the same time the demand for chips surged as consumers, stuck at home, bought electronic devices.<p><p>The combination has created a severe shortage and analysts say there is no immediate solution.<p><p>\"Supply demand balance probably won't be coming back anytime soon, probably going well into 2022,\" says Wayne Lam, an analyst at CCS Insight.<p><p>More technology of business:<p><p>Companies are investing heavily to meet demand, but it takes time to get new production lines up and running.<p><p>Even when chipmakers catch up with demand, it will take the makers of cars and electronics perhaps another two or three months to boost their production.<p><p>The SMMT, which represents the UK car industry, says the chip shortage is making production \"unpredictable\".<p><p>\"There are no quick fixes, with shortages expected well into next year,\" says SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes.<p><p>Fusion is the reaction that powers the Sun and other stars: if that tremendous power could be harnessed on Earth, it would provide a plentiful source of energy, from only a tiny amount of fuel and produce no carbon dioxide.<p><p>But to spark a fusion reaction, and keep it going, requires extreme temperatures and pressures. Scientists and engineers have been wrestling with this problem for decades, and in recent years have made important progress.<p><p>The UK is already home to JET, one of the world's leading fusion projects. Next year, the government will take another step forward, by announcing where it will locate STEP, a prototype fusion power plant, designed to be running by 2040.<p><p>The UK has already committed £220m and will be competing with other national programmes, as well as dozens of private initiatives, that want to make a fusion a commercial reality.<p><p>This video can not be played<p><p>On a smaller scale, next year could be the beginning of a revolution in home heating.<p><p>From April 2022, UK households will be offered subsidies of £5,000 to install heat pumps - electrically powered devices that absorb heat from the air, ground or water around a building.<p><p>The idea is that government subsidies will help spur households to make the switch and give the market a boost.<p><p>It is part of the government's plan to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Moving heating away from gas is important to meet that target, as the energy used for heating UK homes accounts for around 14% of the UK total emissions of carbon dioxide, according to the Climate Change Committee.<p><p>From 2025, new homes will not be allowed to have gas heating, so the race is on to develop alternatives to gas boilers.<p><p>Another alternative to gas will undergo testing next year.<p><p>The British firm Heat Wayv will install heating units that use microwave technology in properties in the UK, in the summer of 2022.<p><p>It has designed the units to replace any type of boiler and the firm says its unit will be cheaper to run over its lifetime than a gas boiler, although those calculations depend on the relative prices of gas and electricity.<p><p>Once the company has reviewed the tests results the unit will go into full-scale production, probably in late Spring of 2023.<p><p>Follow Technology of Business editor Ben Morris on Twitter.<p>", "content_words_count": null, "short_description": "By Ben Morris\nTechnology of Business editor Elon Musk's dream of going to Mars could take a big leap forward next year when his company SpaceX attempts to launch Starship into orbit for the first time.", "main_image": "images/tech-trends-2022-starships-and-missing-chips.jpg", "pub_date": "2022-01-02T19:52:27.199Z", "author": 11, "categories": [2, 45, 46, 47, 48]}}, {"model": "news.article", "pk": 206, "fields": {"name": "The robot chefs that can cook your Christmas dinner", "slug": "the-robot-chefs-that-can-cook-your-christmas-dinner", "content": "<p>By Kitti Palmai and Will Smale\nBusiness reporters<p><p>If you are dreading having to cook your family's Christmas Day dinner then you are definitely not alone.<p><p>But for future Christmases there is now a new alternative - get a robot chef to do everything.<p><p>A number of tech firms are now developing robots that can cook and plate up entire meals, both for commercial and domestic kitchens.<p><p>One of those at the forefront is London-based Moley Robotics, which is due to release its product, the Moley Robotic Kitchen, next year.<p><p>Attached to rails fitted to the ceiling, two robotic arms hang down over your oven and hob, and can cook more than 5,000 different recipes. You just pick the dish in question on a touch screen, add the ingredients it tells you to the built-in containers, and it does everything else.<p><p>It can turn on the oven and hob, pick up and put down saucepans and spatulas, stir, whisk and flip.<p><p>To help develop the robot, Moley employed the services of professional chef Tim Anderson, who back in 2011 won the BBC's MasterChef TV competition.<p><p>He explains how he would make dishes, and the robot would be programed to copy his movement.<p><p>\"I would cook through the recipe in a kitchen with a layout to that of the Moley kitchen, and my movements would be recorded, and then transferred onto the robotic hands and arms,\" says Mr Anderson.<p><p>\"Those movements would then be streamlined by the robotics team, and in the end, we wound up with a consistent program that would produce the same dish every time.\"<p><p>Moley's chief executive Mark Oleynik says the system operates behind a glass screen so that the robotic arms cannot knock into a human.<p><p>\"As an additional measure, we have safety radar systems able to detect any unwanted impacts between the robot and any surface and immediately stop the operation, thus mitigating any such risks altogether.\"<p><p>Mr Oleynik adds that the robot chef could indeed help you make your Christmas Day meal. But for any home cook wishing to rush to place an order, there is currently a significant problem - the cost.<p><p>The minimum price of a Moley Robotic Kitchen is £150,000. Other similarly expensive kitchen robot systems are being developed by Israel's Kitchen Robotics, and US firm Dexai Robotics.<p><p>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<p><p>Yet the price of such systems is likely to drop, says Julia Segal, senior strategist at US food consultancy The Culinary Edge: \"Many of these technologies start well out of reach of the average home cook. However, as the technologies continue to proliferate, costs will eventually come down.\"<p><p>One restaurant group that already uses a robot for all its cooking is French pizza mini-chain Pazzi.<p><p>The business is owned by two robotic engineering students, who designed their own pizza-making robot and then opened their first branch in Paris in 2019. They now have a second outlet in the French capital and another in Brussels.<p><p>Once an order is received, the robot in each location completes the full process - pressing the dough, adding the sauce, putting on the chosen toppings, cooking the pizza, placing it in the takeaway box, slicing it into pieces, and handing it to the customer. This is said to take just five minutes per pizza.<p><p>Co-founder and chief executive Philippe Goldman says the robots have been programed to maintain top quality control. \"When the robot presses the dough, if it detects some holes in the dough, it's going to reject it, put it in the trash and make a new one.\"<p><p>While the kitchen is fully autonomous when the restaurants are open, Pazzi does have human employees. These prepare the ingredients and load the robots in the morning, and then welcome and host customers.<p><p>Mr Goldman adds that Pazzi has now received more than 1,000 enquires about its robots, including \"a lot coming from Italy\", plus from the UK, US and Germany.<p><p>Mikaela Pisani Leal is a data scientist and expert in machine learning at Rootstrap, a technology sector management consultancy.<p><p>She says robot chefs offer restaurants a host of benefits. \"These robots could reduce viruses in food, improve and maintain cleanliness and hygiene... they could turn the industry on its head.\"<p><p>But she also cautions they could result \"in job losses, and people having to reinvent themselves\".<p><p>Wesley Smalley, the owner and head chef of Seasonality, a fine dining restaurant in the Berkshire town of Maidenhead, says that while kitchen robots offer convenience, they won't be of interest to the higher end of the market.<p><p>\"I don't believe a robot can replace a human touch, especially when it comes to quality restaurants and pubs,\" he says. \"The changes and variations of produce would not allow a robot to adjust or change a recipe according to their flavour characteristics.<p><p>\"A human chef brings a natural passion and connection to the provenance of ingredients which fundamentally shows in the creation and execution of menus.<p><p>\"I do however accept that robotics will help with the efficiency and consistency of menial jobs, but let's not forget that someone will still need to program it and stock it with produce.\"<p><p>Yet for many of us due to reluctantly do the cooking at home on Christmas Day, kitchen robots are a tempting thought.<p>", "content_words_count": null, "short_description": "By Kitti Palmai and Will Smale\nBusiness reporters If you are dreading having to cook your family's Christmas Day dinner then you are definitely not alone.
