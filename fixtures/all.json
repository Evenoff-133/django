I've probably received literally hundreds of these images. The kind of stuff I get is close-up shots, or of them performing a sex act.<p><p>\"When I receive the images it makes you feel a bit dirty and you start thinking, 'why me? Why have they sent them to me, is it something I've done'?\"<p><p>She fears it has become \"normalised\" online, compared to what is tolerated in public.<p><p>\"If you had thousands of men flashing you in the street, that's illegal, and that would be a huge problem and a huge conversation, so why are we accepting it online?\"<p><p>Cyber-flashing has become increasingly common during the pandemic as people spend more time online, campaigners have said.<p><p>On Tuesday, a joint committee of MPs will publish its report on the UK government's draft Online Safety Bill, aimed at introducing tougher regulations for social media firms.<p><p>Cyber-flashing is not included in the bill, but campaigners and MPs backing the change hope it will be added and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it should be illegal.<p><p>The campaign to criminalise the act of cyber-flashing is a personal one for Conservative MP for Brecon and Radnor Fay Jones.<p><p>At 17, she was flashed by a man in Cardiff.<p><p>\"I picked my dad up late at night from in town and as I was walking towards the restaurant where my dad was, this guy walked towards me and exposed himself to me.<p><p>\"I have never forgotten it. It stayed with me for such a long time. But, every time I tell that story somebody goes 'Oh, yeah, when I was 19 or when I was on a bus this happened. It's all too common.\"<p><p>But there are concerns about the bill making its way through Parliament.<p><p>Labour's shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens argues that it \"isn't good enough\" and needs \"a lot of changes\".<p><p>But the Cardiff Central MP does believe that cyber-flashing will eventually be included in the bill.<p><p>\"It's a promise from the prime minister,\" she said. \"We will be holding them to account on this because they've made it clear that it should be accepted.\"<p><p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: \"Our comprehensive online safety laws will force social media companies to stamp out online abuse alongside other abhorrent behaviour on their platforms.<p><p>\"Failure to act could mean multi-billion pound fines up to 10% of their global turnover and having their sites blocked.\"<p><p>The UK government hopes the bill will prevent the spread of illegal content and activity such as images of child abuse, terrorist material and hate crimes.<p><p>Ministers hope it will protect children from harmful material and protect adults from legal, but harmful, content.<p><p>Some critics say the bill harms free speech, while others say it fails to recognise the high levels of online violence toward women - the NSPCC said it must be strengthened and have children at its heart.<p><p>Cyber-flashing likely to be made illegal - Dorries<p><p>'Sending unwanted nudes must be standalone crime'<p><p>Online safety plans need more clarity, says Twitter<p>",

She said the assaults took place during a business trip.<p><p>The colleague was then sacked, but a criminal case against him was dropped.<p><p>The client is still thought to be under police investigation.<p><p>The well-publicised case has highlighted the harassment faced by women in the workplace in China.<p><p>The employee told government-backed newspaper Dahe Daily that she was fired late last month. It published a copy of what she said was her termination letter.<p><p>The letter said she had spread false information about the assault and about the company not handling the case.<p><p>It added this \"caused strong social concern and had a bad impact on the company\".<p><p>The employee was quoted as saying: \"I have not made any mistakes, and certainly will not accept this result, and in the future will use legal means to protect my rights and interests.\"<p><p>The woman's lawyer confirmed her dismissal to the New York Times.<p><p>Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce firm, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.<p><p>The woman's account of the incident was published in an eleven-page document, in which she said the colleague raped her in a hotel room while she was unconscious after a \"drunken night\".<p><p>It prompted a social media storm on China's Twitter-like platform, Weibo.<p><p>The woman alleged that the colleague, who held a more senior managerial position in the company, coerced her into travelling to the city of Jinan, which is around 900km (560 miles) from Alibaba's head office in Hangzhou, for a meeting with a client.<p><p>She accused her superiors of ordering her to drink alcohol with co-workers during dinner.<p><p>She said that on the evening of 27 July the client kissed her. She then recalls waking up in her hotel room the next day without her clothes on and with no memory of the night before.<p><p>The woman said she obtained surveillance camera footage that showed the co-worker had gone into her room four times during the evening.<p><p>After returning to Hangzhou, the woman said the incident was reported to Alibaba's human resources (HR) department and senior management and that she had requested the co-worker be fired.<p><p>She said that human resources initially agreed to the request but took no further action.<p><p>Alibaba faced fierce public backlash, later firing the co-worker, identified only as Mr Wang. The company said two executives who failed to act on the allegation also resigned.<p><p>A memo was issued saying Alibaba was \"staunchly opposed to forced drinking culture\".<p><p>Alibaba had earlier said the man accused of rape had admitted that \"there were intimate acts\" while the woman was \"inebriated\".<p><p>Although Mr Wang's case will not progress, prosecutors of the court have approved the arrest of the client who allegedly assaulted the victim. He has been identified by his surname Zhang.<p><p>Mr Zhang has also reportedly been fired by his company.<p><p>The case has divided opinion online. Some social media users posted that the co-worker got away too lightly while others say there wasn't enough evidence against him.<p><p>This latest development is likely to spark similar debates in China, which is grappling with its #MeToo movement.<p><p>China prosecutors drop Alibaba sexual assault case<p><p>Tech giant Alibaba to sack manager accused of rape<p>",
