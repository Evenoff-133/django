Beside me is Takao Saiki, a usually mild-mannered gentleman in his 70s.<p><p>But today Saiki-San is angry.<p><p>\"It's a total joke,\" he says, in perfect English. \"Just ridiculous!\"<p><p>The cause of his distress is a giant construction site blocking our view across the bay - a 1.3-gigawatt coal-fired power station in the making.<p><p>\"I don't understand why we still have to burn coal to generate electricity,\" says Saiki-San's friend, Rikuro Suzuki. \"This plant alone will emit more than seven million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year!\"<p><p>Suzuki-San's point is a good one. Shouldn't Japan be cutting its coal consumption, not increasing it, at a time of great concern about coal's impact on the climate?<p><p>So why the coal? The answer is the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.<p><p>In 2010 about one third of Japan's electricity came from nuclear power, and there were plans to build a lot more. But then the 2011 disaster hit, and all Japan's nuclear power plants were shut down. Ten years later most remain closed - and there is a lot of resistance to restarting them.<p><p>In their place Japan's gas-fired power stations have been doing a lot of overtime. But, as Britain has found out recently, natural gas is expensive.<p><p>So, the Japanese government decided to build 22 new coal-fired power stations, to run on cheap coal imported from Australia. Economically it made sense. Environmentally, not so much. Japan is now under intense pressure to stop using coal.<p><p>Instead of closing the old coal plants and switching to renewables, Japan's answer is to switch to burning hydrogen or ammonia.<p><p>\"The investment made by electric power companies in coal-fired power plants would suddenly be useless without value in their balance sheet,\" says Prof Tomas Kaberger, an expert on energy policy at Chalmers University in Sweden.<p><p>\"And it would create financial difficulties for electric power companies and then for banks and pension funds. And that is the challenge for Japan.\"<p><p>The plants can be quite easily converted to burning hydrogen or ammonia, neither of which produce any carbon dioxide. So this seems like a good solution.<p><p>But Japan's government has much bigger ambitions than that. It wants to be the world's first \"hydrogen economy\".<p><p>This is where the carmaker Toyota comes in.<p><p>It's another lovely sunny day and I'm in downtown Tokyo, at a shiny new hydrogen filling station. Standing on the forecourt is a sleek new Toyota Mirai. This is a big luxury car, about the size of a large Lexus.<p><p>I slip into the leather-clad cabin, press the \"start\" button and glide out on to the street. The car is extremely smooth, completely silent, and the only thing dribbling on to the road behind me is a bit of water.<p><p>The Mirai (which means future in Japanese) is Toyota's first zero-emissions electric car. Unlike other electric cars, the Mirai doesn't have a huge battery under the floor. Instead, it has a fuel cell under the bonnet, and hydrogen tanks under the back seat. Hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a fuel cell to form water, with the reaction releasing energy as electricity, which runs the electric motors. It's the same technology that was used to power the Apollo spacecraft on the Moon missions.<p><p>To many people this technology is an odd choice. It's more expensive and complicated than batteries. Elon Musk has called hydrogen cars \"stupid\".<p><p>Not true, says Hisashi Nakai, the head of Toyota's public affairs division. He says the company's vision for fuel cells goes much further than just cars.<p><p>\"I know people have different opinions,\" he tells me, \"but the important thing is realising carbon neutrality. We need to think about how we can make the most out of fuel cell technology. We strongly believe in hydrogen as a powerful and important energy.\"<p><p>What Nakai-san says shows Toyota is thinking of a future where hydrogen fuel cells are everywhere, in homes and offices and factories, as well as cars. And it wants to be at the forefront of this new hydrogen society.<p><p>This brings us to the final, and most important question. Where is the hydrogen to power Japan zero carbon society going to come from?<p><p>The answer is \"blue hydrogen\".<p><p>Make hydrogen from water using renewable energy and you get \"green hydrogen\". The problem is green hydrogen is really expensive.<p><p>Instead, today most hydrogen is made from natural gas, or even coal. That is cheap but it produces lots of greenhouse gases. However, if you capture those greenhouse gases and bury them in the ground, you are allowed to call it \"blue hydrogen\".<p><p>This is exactly what Japan says it is going to do.<p><p>Earlier this year, Japan and Australia opened a joint project in the state of Victoria to turn a type of coal called lignite, or brown coal, into hydrogen. The hydrogen is then liquified to minus 253C, then piped into a specially built ship which carries it to Japan.<p><p>What happens to the greenhouse gases produced at the site? Right now, they go straight up into the atmosphere. But Japan and Australia are promising that, at some point in the future, they will begin capturing the greenhouse gas produced at the Latrobe Valley site and inject it into the sea floor off the coast.<p><p>Climate change campaigners are horrified by this plan. They say the technology to capture and store greenhouse gases is unproven and it will lock Japan into digging up vast quantities of brown coal for decades to come.<p><p>According to Prof Kaberger, the biggest hole in the plan is economic.<p><p>\"Technically it's possible, but it will always be expensive,\" he says. \"Using fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage will always be more expensive than using fossil fuels alone, and now in many parts of the world renewable electricity is already cheaper than fossil fuels without carbon capture.\"<p><p>Prof Kaberger thinks the Japanese government chose blue hydrogen a decade ago when renewables were expensive, and they are now locked into a plan that no longer makes sense.<p><p>\"Japanese companies need cheap electricity to be competitive and they need clean electricity to be internationally acceptable,\" he says. \"That means they need renewable electricity. Delaying this development will harm the Japanese economy.\"<p><p>In the meantime, on the edge of Tokyo Bay, construction continues apace. The giant new coal-fired power station will go online in 2023. It is expected to run for at least 40 years.<p><p>\"I am ashamed of Japan,\" says Hikari Matsumoto, a 21-year-old activist who has joined us to look out from the hillside.<p><p>\"I'm so frustrated,\" she says. \"In other countries young people are out on the street protesting, but Japanese people are so quiet.

To enable firms to keep tabs on their delivery drivers and plan routes, US firm HyperTrack offers an app and GPS-based tracking system.<p><p>The company's vice president of sales, Francois Martel, says the system allows both retailers and wholesalers to give customers more accurate delivery times.<p><p>\"Imagine you are a retailer, and are ordering from a wholesaler,\" he says. \"Wholesalers don't have that same Amazon-like technology, and yet they want it to provide a reliable delivery time window that is not 8-4.<p><p>\"The windows can be so large at the moment they are laughable, so using us to provide tighter windows, and holding to that time, is changing the experience in a significant way.\"<p><p>For Norwegian firm, Gelato (despite the name it has nothing to do with ice cream), its big idea is to help firms take the distance out of deliveries.<p><p>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<p><p>Its software allows e-commerce sellers of physical products such as clothing, posters and books to connect with manufacturers around the world.<p><p>For example, if a British designer of patterned t-shirts gets an order from Australia, rather than posting the item from the UK, it can get the item of clothing printed and delivered by an Australian firm.<p><p>Henrik Müller-Hansen, the founder and chief executive of Gelato, says that there are not just huge environmental benefits. \"What local production and on demand production allows you to do is to reduce the distribution distances, but also to match supply and demand,\" he says.<p><p>\"You no longer have to guess. In the old days, in order to reach economies of scale, you sat there as a big global manufacturing company and tried to assess demand. Now, with on-demand local production, you produce when you receive the order.\"<p><p>Mr Müller-Hansen expects his business to grow alongside developments in 3D printing, which will enable more products to be easily manufactured remotely.<p><p>However, perhaps the most exciting development in delivery technology - and especially for Santa Claus - is cargo-carrying drones. (Tens of millions of them would really help him out on Christmas Eve.)<p><p>Yet, while the technology already exists, it is still waiting for regulatory approval by governments to start national commercial use.<p><p>Instead, there are currently a number of pilot schemes around the world. Naturally Amazon has its own project - Prime Air - but a number of smaller firms have also developed their own drones.<p><p>One such company is Israeli-company Flytrex, which is already enabling restaurants in the North Carolina town of Holy Springs to deliver their food via its drones. It is part of a trial authorised by the US Federal Aviation Administration.<p><p>In the future drones may mean that you can order all your Christmas presents on 24 December, and get them delivered that afternoon.<p><p>But in the meantime, Kate Lester says it is best to order your presents early. \"Get your orders in soon, because it will be fatal to leave it until 21 December to do it this year.

Inside the booths a life-size hologram of a person appears.<p><p>The portals have built-in speakers, so that the hologram's 'voice' can be heard.

In fact, if there is no light on the glass so that you cannot see it reflecting, then you do think the person is actually there.\"<p><p>The Portl system is aimed at business customers, and is currently also being used by other firms such as Netflix and T-Mobile.<p><p>The portals cost from $60,000 (£45,000) each, so they are certainly expensive, although the company says they can be rented for considerably less.<p><p>\"In a few years time, this is going to become a regular way of communicating between offices,\" adds Mr Nussbaum.<p><p>At Microsoft, its hologram communication technology is based around a headset called HoloLens 2. At $3,500 per unit they are considerably cheaper than Portl's system, but the 3D holograms are not lifelike.<p><p>Instead, when two or more headset wearers call each other, their holograms are projected in front of each of them as somewhat cartoon-like avatars, that appear to be standing in the same room.<p><p>\"It would appear that they are in the same physical space, and they could walk around a virtual table and collaborate on things,\" said Greg Sullivan, director of mixed reality at Microsoft.<p><p>Also aimed at business customers, German engineering group Thyssenkrupp is one firm putting the technology to practical use.<p><p>One of the world's largest manufacturers of lifts or elevators, it used to have to fly its technicians around the world to make any necessary repairs.

You can read subtle cues like who's looking at whom, \" he says.<p><p>Yet, he cautions that problems may occur in the future if these holographic images become so real that distinguishing them from an actual person will become impossible.<p><p>\"If you can create digital or synthetic experiences that get closer and closer to how you perceive reality, you're more vulnerable to being manipulated,\" says Mr Wetzstein.<p><p>Back at Portl, one of the firm's earliest investors was Tim Draper, who was also an early backer of both Skype and Tesla.

Cargo bike sales in Europe grew by 38% in 2020 and are projected to grow by another 66% this year, according to a European cargo bike industry survey of 38 specialised producers.<p><p>By far the largest European market is Germany, where the national Bike Association (ZIV) registered 103,000 cargo bikes sold in 2020.<p><p>Germany ranks ahead of Denmark with 25,000, the Netherlands with 16,000 and France with 12,000 sold last year, says the European Bike Association (Conebi).<p><p>Ms Paulussen explains that there are several things that she loves about her cargo bike. \"It's a green and swift way of getting around, I can comfortably chat to my kids who usually sit in the front, and thanks to the electric motor, I don't even break a sweat.\"<p><p>The rising demand for green transport and the technological advances in e-bikes are widely seen as two crucial factors driving the trend. In the survey, cargo bike manufacturers report that last year 92% of their models sold were electric.<p><p>More technology of business:<p><p>That comes at a price, explains Philipp Runge, a sales adviser at Ahoi Velo, one of Germany's largest cargo bike shops, based in Hamburg. The cheapest electric model in his shop starts at €3,800 ($4,280; £3,210) .<p><p>\"But as cargo bikes become a life-style choice for some people, producers race to build the Rolls-Royce of the market,\" he explains.<p><p>One example is the recently released Ca Go, featuring an electronic gearbox, a crash cushioned box, cable steering for tighter turning and folding seats with vibration absorption and adjustable headrests. With all optional extras it costs more than €10,000.<p><p>\"Of course, our bike wasn't cheap\", concedes Mr Paulussen. \"But it allows us to do without a car, which would be a lot more expensive, and luckily, it was subsidised with a €1,000 by the city of Munich.\"<p><p>Several other countries, such as Austria, Switzerland, France, Italy and Belgium, now also offer subsidies, say advocacy group European Cyclists' Federation.<p><p>Yet, the subsidy schemes are often organised in a confusing way. In Germany and Austria alone, there are more than 100 communal and regional schemes, says Arne Behrensen of German pressure group cargobike.jetzt.<p><p>\"Some, like that in Munich, are longstanding and well-run,\" he says. \"But all in all, the local fragmentation is extremely inefficient, as every city, or region, has to design, calculate and administer its own framework - which often run out after a few months.\"<p><p>Last year, when Hamburg dedicated €700,000 to subsidise 33% of any newly purchased cargo bike in the city, the money was used up in less than 30 minutes.<p><p>\"The same thing had previously happened in Berlin\", says Mr Behrensen. \"At worst, such short-lived chaos throws the industry into disarray, by creating demand spikes and inducing disappointed applicants to put off their bike purchase till the start of a later scheme.\"<p><p>Mr Behrensen wants to see more efficient national programmes, as recently introduced in France.<p><p>But things are improving, when Germany expanded a scheme for commercially used cargo bikes in March, in little over six months, more than 2,000 applications for subsidies had been approved - almost five times more than in the whole of 2020.<p><p>Bike dealer Philip Runge says that, up until a few years ago, commercial customers made up only about 10% of his clients. Today they make up about 35%. \"We're even opening a second shop in Hamburg, focusing on heavy-duty bikes for commercial clients such plumbers, dry cleaners, nursing homes or bars and restaurants.\"<p><p>Commercial and private cargo bikes are evolving really, says Mr Runge. Manufacturers are starting to produce tailored components - such as the first cargo-specific tyre, by Schwalbe, which combines shock absorption and sturdiness; engines with more torque by Bosch, Shimano or Brose; more robust brakes and wheels, inspired by the automotive industry.<p><p>\"More and more expertise, know-how and design elements from the car industry are now moving into cargo-bikes\", explains Arne Behrensen of cargobike.jetzt, Volkswagen and BMW among them.<p><p>The Ono, one of the most advanced heavy-duty cargo bikes available for commercial use, has a weather protected driver's cabin, radio frequency identification device (RFID) locks for the vehicle, plus batteries that can be replaced within seconds at exchange stations. It also has a freight-carrying capacity of 200kg (440lb).<p><p>It is hoped this type of vehicle - combining van comforts with the ecological flexibility of a bike - might induce the same feeling in delivery drivers, that Grit Paulussen has on her own cargo-bike: a sense of unusual freedom and pure bliss.<p>", "content_words_count": null, "short_description": "By Janek Schmidt\nTechnology of Business reporter When Grit Paulussen and her partner Matthias Bogus wanted to treat themselves to a rare evening out recently, they worked out a plan.

By looking at the crime patterns, users can identify crime hotspots so they can plan safer routes.\"<p><p>Since launching in March this year, the app has had more than 560,000 downloads.<p><p>At the University of Bath, researchers are trying to solve the problem of safety products which are difficult to physically activate. They are developing a women's smartwatch app called Epowar which would automatically send alerts if it senses the user is in distress - by monitoring heart rate and body motion.<p><p>Co-founder, student E-J Roodt, said the idea came to her while jogging in a badly-lit park, and worrying about the risk of an attack.<p><p>\"When I saw that smartwatches were being used to detect heart attacks I thought, well, maybe that technology could be applied to women's safety,\" she said.<p><p>Although the sample size is small, the app uses artificial intelligence to recognise distress, and responds if a user is attacked when walking or running alone.<p><p>Ms Roodt said: \"It occurred to us that a smartwatch with this app may be a way to alert others if a woman is restrained or struggling.<p><p>\"The key is that it would all happen automatically, and an assailant would have little or no time to prevent this - which is not always possible with conventional panic buttons, rape alarms or your mobile phone.\"<p><p>Founder of the bSafe app for smartphones, Rich Larsen, believes his technology could help bring about prosecutions.<p><p>It has an emergency alarm feature which is voice-activated. It then automatically starts live-streaming video and audio to chosen contacts, and records everything that is happening.<p><p>Mr Larsen said: \"These recordings could be used in evidence in court cases - like rape - which are often hard to prove.\"<p><p>The features of the app are based on the experience of his daughter, Charlen, who was raped. Charlen - who's waived her right to anonymity in order to speak out on the issue - thinks if she had had bSafe, she wouldn't have had to struggle as much with the guilt and shame she felt.<p><p>Crown Prosecution Service data for 2020 shows that of the 58,845 rapes recorded, only 2,102 were prosecuted, with 1,439 resulting in convictions.<p><p>bSafe has also been of interest to other app companies. Mr Larsen said: \"We are currently developing a API-platform so we can easily implement these features in other apps.\"<p><p>In July the Home Office launched a £5 million fund to help improve the safety of women in public spaces at night. Some of the successful bids include initiatives involving technology.<p><p>For example, police in Bristol are using new kits to test whether drinks have been spiked in nightclubs.<p><p>Cheshire police are improving current call handling technology to provide an instant visible and reassuring response to a female calling for support.<p><p>West Yorkshire Combined Authority is promoting access to an online link with safety information for women on public transport, such as bus tracking, so there is no longer a need to stand alone at a bus stop.<p><p>Technology can also be misused by those seeking to harm or frighten people. So, for instance, the same technology that allows you to find your lost smartphone can be used by someone wanting to track or stalk someone.<p><p>Paladin, the national anti-stalking advocacy service, says tech firms need to do more to protect victims if tech is misused.<p><p>Rachel Horman-Brown, chairwoman of the charity, said: \"Many victims are tracked and monitored through their phones or tablets by spyware.<p><p>\"So actually stalkers don't even need to physically get a tracking device on the victim to be able to monitor them.<p><p>\"Spyware is concerning as it can enable a stalker to switch on the camera on a victim's mobile phone, so that they can see and hear what is happening. They can also read and send text messages from the victim's phone, as well as tracking their whereabouts.\"<p><p>The proliferation of tracking devices, like Apple AirTags or The Tile, which help you find your wallet, keys or luggage, has also led to an increase in fears of stalking.<p><p>\"These small inexpensive tags can potentially make it very easy for a stalker to hide one in the victim's car or personal possessions, and then be able to track their victim's whereabouts,\" said Ms Horman-Brown.<p><p>Farah Nazeer, chief executive at Women's Aid, believes the issue of safety cannot be solved by tech alone: \"Whilst technology - such as safety apps on phones and smartwatches - can play a role in helping women feel safer on the streets, these interventions are temporary sticking plasters, which ignore the real cause of male violence against women.<p><p>\"Women feel unsafe on our streets, not because of a lack of street lighting or safety apps, but because of the culture of sexism and misogyny, which makes violence against women and girls all too common. It must not be tolerated any longer.<p><p>\"Far too many women continue to tell us that their experiences at the hands of violent men are belittled, disbelieved and dismissed by police and the criminal justice system - the very services that are supposed to protect us.<p><p>\"We must focus on challenging the sexist attitudes that are deeply rooted in these services and systems, so that women can walk home feeling confident that they are safe and protected.\"<p><p>CCTV app aims to improve women's safety<p><p>Street safety phone tips shared online<p><p>Stalking rises during Covid pandemic - police<p><p>Student 'degraded' by stalker asking for sex<p><p>Are we all becoming unknowing spies?<p><p>Apple updates AirTags after stalking fears<p>", "content_words_count": null, "short_description": "By Shiona McCallum\nTechnology reporter Half of all women have felt unsafe at some point walking alone in the dark, according to recent figures from the Office for National Statistics.

No, I don't recognise the name,\" he said.<p><p>\"His family is registered here, so who are you?\" we asked.<p><p>After some friendly chat we explained we were reporters from the BBC, and the mood suddenly changed.<p><p>\"I'm not telling you where he is and you shouldn't try to find him. You shouldn't have come here,\" the young man said angrily.<p><p>I didn't sleep well that night, thinking of the conflicting advice I'd been given by people in the security sector.<p><p>Some said trying to track down wanted cyber-criminals on their home soil was risky. \"They'll have armed guards,\" I was told. \"You'll end up in a ditch somewhere,\" another warned. Others said it would be fine - \"They're just computer geeks.\"<p><p>All said we wouldn't get anywhere near them.<p><p>In a press conference two years ago, the FBI named nine members of the Russian hacking group, Evil Corp, accusing Igor Turashev and the gang's alleged leader, Maksim Yakubets, of stealing or extorting more than $100m in hacks affecting 40 different countries.<p><p>The victims range from small businesses to multinationals like Garmin, as well as charities and a school. They're just the ones we know about.<p><p>The US Department of Justice says the men are \"cyber-enabled bank robbers\" staging ransomware attacks, or hacking into accounts to steal money.<p><p>The announcement made Maksim Yakubets, then only 32, a poster boy for the playboy Russian hacker.<p><p>Footage of the gang obtained by the UK's National Crime Agency, showed the men driving custom Lamborghinis, laughing with wads of cash and playing with a pet lion cub.<p><p>The FBI's indictment of the two men was the result of years of work, including interviews with former gang members and the use of cyber-forensics. Some information dated back as far as 2010, when Russian police were still prepared to collaborate with their US colleagues.<p><p>Those days are long gone now. The Russian government routinely brushes off US hacking accusations against its citizens.<p><p>In fact, not only are the hackers allowed to carry on, they are recruited by the security services too.<p><p>Our investigation into Maksim Yakubets began in an unlikely place - a golf course about two hours outside Moscow.<p><p>This was the venue for his spectacular wedding in 2017, a video of which was spotted by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and widely shared.<p><p>Tellingly, Yakubets' face is never shown in the footage, filmed by a wedding video production company, but he can be seen dancing to live music performed by a famous Russian singer under a beautiful light show.<p><p>Wedding planner Natalia wouldn't go into specifics about Yakubets' big day but showed us around some of the key locations, including a pillared building carved out of the hills near a lake.<p><p>\"It's our exclusive room,\" she said. \"The newlyweds love to get inside for photo shoots and romance.\"<p><p>As we were driven around by golf cart I did some maths. With what we were being told, this grand wedding would have cost considerably more than the estimates I'd heard previously of around $250,000. The price tag was potentially closer to half a million dollars, or even $600,000.<p><p>We don't know how the special day was paid for, but if Yakubets picked up the bill it's an indication of just how lavish his lifestyle is.<p><p>Nor is Igor Turashev, 40, keeping a low profile.<p><p>Using public records, my colleague Andrey Zakharov, BBC Russia's Cyber Reporter, found three companies registered in his name.<p><p>All have offices in Moscow's prestigious Federation Tower, a shiny skyscraper in the financial district that wouldn't look out of place in Manhattan or London's Canary Wharf.<p><p>A puzzled receptionist looked for a phone number, and found that the offices didn't have one. She did find a mobile phone under the firm's name though, and put us through.<p><p>We called it and waited. A Frank Sinatra song played for about five minutes, then finally someone picked up, sounding as though he was on a busy street - only to hang up when we said we were journalists.<p><p>As Andrey explained, Turashev is not wanted in Russia so no-one is stopping him renting this expensive city-centre office space.<p><p>It may also be convenient for him to be located among financial companies, including some that deal in the cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, that Evil Corp is alleged to have collected from victims in ransomware attacks - reportedly $10m-worth in one case.<p><p>A Bloomberg report using research from Bitcoin analysts Chainalysis claims that the Federation Tower houses numerous crypto firms that act like \"cash machines for cyber-criminals\".<p><p>We tried two other addresses linked to Turashev and another key Evil Corp figure called Denis Gusev, and made numerous approaches by phone and email, but no-one answered.<p><p>Andrey and I spent a long time trying to find a place of work for Maksim Yakubets.<p><p>He used to be a director of his mother's cattle feed company, but these days he appears to have no registered business or employer.<p><p>What we did find, though, were addresses where he might still live, so one night we went to give them a knock.<p><p>At one, a man laughed over the intercom as we explained where we were from.<p><p>\"Maksim Yakubets isn't here. He hasn't been here for probably 15 years. I'm his dad,\" he said.<p><p>To our surprise Yakubets senior then came out into the hallway and gave us an impassioned 20-minute interview on camera, angrily condemning the US authorities for indicting his son.<p><p>This video can not be played<p><p>The $5m US reward for information leading to his son's arrest - the highest ever bounty for a named cyber-criminal - had led the family to live in fear of attack, Mr Yakubets said, demanding that we publish his words.<p><p>\"The Americans created a problem for my family, for many people who know us, for our relatives. What was the purpose? American justice has turned into Soviet justice. He was not questioned, he was not interrogated, there were no procedures that would prove his guilt.\"<p><p>He denied that his son was a cyber-criminal. When I asked how he thought he had become so rich, he laughed, saying that I was exaggerating the price tag of the wedding and that the luxury cars were rented. Maksim's salary was higher than average, he said, because \"he works, he gets paid, he has a job\".<p><p>\"What does he do for work then?\" I asked.<p><p>\"Why should I tell you?\" he replied. \"What about our private lives?\"<p><p>He said he hadn't had any contact with his son since the indictment, so could not put us in touch with him.<p><p>Yakubets and Turashev are part of the growing list of Russian citizens to be issued with cyber-sanctions as the West struggles to respond to cyber-attacks.<p><p>More Russian people and organisations have been sanctioned and indicted than those of any other nationality.<p><p>Indictments prevent the hackers from travelling abroad, while the sanctions freeze any assets they have in the West, and ban them from doing business with Western firms.<p><p>Last year the European Union started issuing cyber-sanctions, following in the US's footsteps, and it's mainly Russians who have been named and shamed on this list too.<p><p>The vast majority of the individuals on these lists are said to have direct links to the Russian state, hacking in order to spy, project power or exert pressure. While all nations hack each other, the US, EU and allies claim that some of the Russian attacks cross a line, in terms of what is acceptable.<p><p>Some of the men are accused of causing widespread blackouts in Ukraine by hacking power grids. Others are wanted for trying to hack into a chemical weapons testing facility in the wake of the Salisbury poisonings.<p><p>The Kremlin denies all accusations, routinely laughing them off as Western hysteria and \"Russophobia\".<p><p>As there are no clear rules for what is acceptable nation state hacking, we deliberately concentrated our investigation on the individuals accused of being criminals, hacking for profit.<p><p>So do cyber-sanctions against \"criminal\" hackers work?<p><p>Speaking to Yakubets' father it seems that they do have some impact - at the very least they made him furious.<p><p>However Evil Corp appears to have been unaffected.<p><p>Cyber-security researchers allege the crew are still carrying out lucrative cyber-attacks on mainly Western targets.<p><p>The \"golden rule\" of Russian hacking, according to researchers and former hackers, is that non-state-employed criminal hackers can hack who they like, as long as the victims are not in Russian-speaking or former Soviet territories.<p><p>The rule appears to work, as cyber-security researchers have for many years noticed fewer attacks in those countries. They've also found that some malware is designed to avoid computers with Russian language systems.<p><p>Lilia Yapparova, an investigative reporter working at Meduza, one of few independent news organisations in the country, says the golden rule is helpful for the intelligence services, which can then exploit the skills hackers have developed while working for themselves.<p><p>\"It's more valuable for the FSB to enlist hackers in Russia than to put them in jail. One of my sources, who is an ex-FSB officer, told me that he personally tried to enlist some of the guys from Evil Corp to do some work for him,\" she says.<p><p>The US claims that Maksim Yakubets and other wanted hackers - including Evgeniy Bogachev, who has a $3m bounty out for his arrest - have worked directly for the intelligence services.<p><p>It may not be a coincidence that Yakubets' father-in-law, seen in the wedding video, is a former high-level member of the FSB.<p><p>We asked the Russian government to comment on the fact that hackers seem to operate freely in Russia, but received no reply.<p><p>When Vladimir Putin was asked about this at the Geneva summit with Joe Biden this summer, he denied that high-profile attacks were originating in his country and even claimed that most cyber-attacks began in the US. But he said he would work with the US to \"bring order\".<p><p>In the last six months the US and its allies have gone beyond cyber-sanctions, and started employing a far more aggressive tactic.<p><p>They have begun hacking back against cyber-crime gangs and have successfully taken some of them offline, at least temporarily. REvil and DarkSide have announced on forums that they are no longer operating because of law enforcement action.<p><p>On two occasions US government hackers have even managed to retrieve millions of dollars of Bitcoin stolen from victims.<p><p>An international effort involving Europol and the US Department of Justice has also seen alleged hackers arrested in South Korea, Kuwait, Romania and Ukraine.<p><p>However, cyber security researchers say more groups are surfacing, and attacks are occurring every week. The phenomenon will not go away, they say, as long as hackers can flourish in Russia.<p><p>Russian musician Plinofficial once dreamed of becoming the biggest rap artist on the planet.

It is one of nine such machines that Zaidi has operating in Kenya.<p><p>Using a small panel on the front of the machine, he keys in the amount of money that a customer wants to spend and seconds later the corresponding quantity of milk pours into a recycled plastic bottle or bag that the customer brings from home.<p><p>\"Since I got the vending machine, the number of customers has sharply increased,\" he says.<p><p>Monday to Thursday, Mr Opati sells 150 litres of milk a day. On Fridays and weekends that jumps to 300 litres, giving him 6,000 Kenyan shillings ($53; £40) in profit a week. \"For me, it's a good business,\" he says.<p><p>\"These vending machines have become very important for us in Kibera,\" says one of his customers, Caroline Atieno, while queuing in front of the tall machine, which is decorated with pictures of black and white Friesian cows.<p><p>She has five children and says she gets through a lot of milk: \"With this ATM, I can spend whatever I want on milk, even as little as 10 Kenyan shillings (9 cents; 7p), based on the money that I have in my pocket.\"<p><p>This is a key attraction of the selling in this way, Kenyans who live in such settlements, often earn less than a dollar a day, so being able to buy fresh produce in small quantities is a huge bonus.<p><p>\"The milk is also much cheaper than the packed long life milk which is sold at most places in Kibera, and [it] tastes better,\" Ms Atieno adds.<p><p>The pasteurised milk from Zaidi's ATM goes for 65 Kenyan shillings a litre, while packed ultra-heated (UHT) long life-milk normally costs around 110 Kenyan shillings a litre and is only sold in packages of 200ml, 300ml or larger.<p><p>In recent years, vending machines have been popping up across Nairobi's numerous informal settlements - selling milk, cooking oil, clean renewable cooking fuel and sanitary pads.<p><p>\"We decided to start selling milk through ATMs as it removes the cost of packaging, improves the costs of logistics and allows us to sell milk without attracting VAT,\" says Graham Benton, co-founder and chief executive of Zaidi Technologies.<p><p>\"The ATMs also help us to unlock the 80% of the market that has remained untapped by larger, regulated businesses.\"<p><p>This video can not be played<p><p>More technology of business:<p><p>The machines have also provided new business opportunities, explains Vivian Kenyatta. The 28-year-old single mum formed a youth group of 20 members. \"With our savings, we wanted to start a business to uplift ourselves and these ATMs appeared to be rather affordable.\"<p><p>While they did not have enough pooled cash to open a whole shop, they were able to buy a cooking oil vending machine for 100,000 Kenyan shillings ($890; £670) this year and rent a small space, from where they sell the oil.<p><p>\"We make a profit of around 400 Kenyan shillings a day, which we put on a bank account and we might use for emergencies, like when one of our group members needs to go to a hospital,\" the single mother explains this while she dispenses cooking oil from the machine into a recycled plastic cooking oil bottle for her next customer.<p><p>Although operating vending machines in deprived areas of Africa comes with challenges.<p><p>Often, shop owners can only afford the very cheapest machines, which might not be suitable for food. They also may not be able to pay for proper maintenance. To save money they might turn machines off when they are empty - meaning any residue goes bad or congeals in the system.<p><p>Power cuts, which are very common in Kenya and neighbouring countries, are an added disruption.<p><p>Zaidi Technologies has developed a different business model to counter some of these issues: it owns and installs the vending machines, the shopkeeper then pays for the electricity and provides water for cleaning. In return they receive a commission of 4 shillings for every litre of milk they sell.<p><p>Unscrupulous shopkeepers have also been known to dilute milk, but Zaidi Technologies are working on a tamper-proof system - after pasteurisation, the milk containers will be delivered to shops and slotted into the machines by the delivery drivers, who will then lock the vending machines.<p><p>\"The systems will be automated, so that we can see if the door is tampered with, or, if the milk violates our temperature thresholds, allowing us to take the system offline until a technician can come and service it,\" explains Mr Benton.<p><p>Technology company, KOKO Networks, has developed its own vending machine system specifically for the African market, to supply its bioethanol cooking fuel.<p><p>Like the milk machines, the KOKO machines can dispense very small amounts of fuel, to cater for cash-strapped customers.<p><p>\"To protect fuel quality and ensure safe handling... our ATM's have lots of safety features and sensors. Our fuel can only be dispensed into a registered KOKO fuel canister and with the ATM we avoid creating mountains of plastic bottling waste\", says Sagun Saxena, executive director at KOKO Kenya.<p><p>When customers refill their fuel canister, they buy the fuel directly from KOKO, using mobile money payments, while KOKO pays a commission to the shopkeeper.<p><p>The company was launched in Nairobi in partnership with Shell in 2019 and now runs more than 750 bioethanol vending machines in Kenya and will enter other East African countries in the coming year.<p><p>Mr Saxena sees lots of opportunities for vending machines in the food sector as well. \"Currently packaging, handling and trading via small shops adds a lot of costs,\" he says.<p><p>\"That's why retail prices for food are higher in small, local shops versus even the larger supermarkets in Nairobi. Bringing these costs down through the use of vending machines, will benefit many households.\"<p>", "content_words_count": null, "short_description": "By Andrea Dijkstra\nBusiness reporter, Nairobi, Kenya Shopkeeper, Jackson Opati, has stopped selling packaged milk from his store and instead switched to using a vending machine dispensing fresh milk. \"This ATM is a more lucrative business,\" he explains.", "main_image": "images/how-vending-machines-are-making-life-better-for-kenyans.jpg", "pub_date": "2021-12-14T19:14:20.510Z", "author": 3, "categories": [55, 58, 61, 94]}}, {"model": "news.article", "pk": 95, "fields": {"name": "BitMart: Crypto-exchange loses $150m to hackers", "slug": "bitmart-crypto-exchange-loses-150m-to-hackers", "content": "<p>Crypto-currency exchange BitMart says hackers have stolen about $150m (£113m) worth of tokens from its \"hot wallets\".<p><p>Those affected, one storing Ethereum and one Binance Smart Chain tokens, \"carry a small percentage of assets on BitMart and all of our other wallets are secure and unharmed\", it said.<p><p>But the first security company to notice the hack estimated the stolen tokens were worth closer to $200m.<p><p>Bitmart is suspending customer withdrawals until further notice.<p><p>\"At this moment we are still concluding the possible methods used,\" it said.<p><p>\"We are now conducting a thorough security review and we will post updates as we progress.\"<p><p>And it would try to \"maintain transparency\" as it dealt with the aftermath of the attack.<p><p>This video can not be played<p><p>Many investors recommend moving large amounts of crypto-currency not needed for day-to-day trading to \"cold\" storage, disconnected from the wider internet.<p><p>Mt Gox handled most of the world's Bitcoin transactions - until 850,000 bitcoins went \"missing\", shuttering the company.<p><p>And since then, attacks have been a constant problem for crypto-exchanges and investors.<p><p>Major hacks on crypto-currency platforms are so regular it is hard to keep up.<p><p>And the latest follows the pattern we are becoming used to - huge amounts of stolen crypto-currency and tiny amounts of detail from the victim.<p><p>We do not know:<p><p>Past hacks have seen a multitude of outcomes.<p><p>Sometimes users are refunded, sometimes they are partially refunded, sometimes the company goes bust and on one occasion a hacker even returned all the money.<p><p>The only certainty is this hack will add further fuel to the fire for people calling for regulation of these increasingly important companies.<p><p>The real victims of mass crypto-hacks<p><p>RIP Mr Goxx: cryptocurrency-trading hamster dies<p>", "content_words_count": null, "short_description": "Crypto-currency exchange BitMart says hackers have stolen about $150m (£113m) worth of tokens from its \"hot wallets\".

No way of calling for an ambulance, no way of asking for less urgent help and no way of talking to his power company.<p><p>His 84-year-old neighbour was in the same quandary: \"Her phone is exactly the same as mine, one of the new digital phones from BT, and nothing worked.\"<p><p>Under the old landline system - the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) - home phones still function in a power cut (unless the lines themselves come down) because the exchange has back-up power which feeds to the phone through the line itself.<p><p>But this system is being switched off in 2025 and BT Openreach, which manages the UK's phone and internet network, has already begun moving people over to Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) connections, which work through broadband.<p><p>Mr Bownass's phone line had worked \"perfectly\" for the 50 years he has lived in his house, he says, but he switched to VOIP three months ago. The power cut knocked out his landline for a week.<p><p>BT, and the industry regulator Ofcom, say PSTN equipment is becoming harder and more expensive to maintain and new digital technology is needed to secure the future of our phone services.<p><p>But Storm Arwen has highlighted a number of problems with the new technology, and its rollout.<p><p>First, it does not work without power. Second, it does not work if the broadband connection fails. Third, guidance that people use mobile phones as back-up is redundant where reception is non-existent. Fourth, even where mobile reception is reliable, severe storms can damage masts or knock out their power supply.<p><p>In addition, charging a mobile phone during a power cut poses a challenge.<p><p>Moira McLean, who lives near Berwick in Northumberland, says struggling to load web pages on a bad mobile connection was \"hellish with dwindling battery and no way of recharging\".<p><p>\"Coverage is pretty ropey here but was far worse that weekend, compounded by the fact I couldn't get my car out to search of a decent signal because the power cut knocked my garage doors out too,\" she says.<p><p>She feels having no phone in an emergency would be \"life threatening\".<p><p>Greg Round from St John's Chapel in Weardale is also \"seriously concerned about BT Digital Voice\" as the power cut made him \"realise how useless it is\" without electricity.<p><p>\"No-one in a rural area should be forced into having this until they have found a satisfactory way of backing it up,\" he says.<p><p>A petition calling on BT Openreach to discontinue the VOIP rollout in his area has more than 200 signatures.<p><p>Ann Hetherington, who lives in Northumberland, says her mobile signal was so poor and her broadband so slow she relied on a plug-in analogue phone for the eight days she had no power.<p><p>\"Given how difficult it was to communicate with Northern Powergrid and Northumbrian Water, I would not have wanted to stand outside at the one point that we sometimes get a [mobile] signal,\" she said.<p><p>\"It is frightening to live like this and not appropriate for the 21st Century.\"<p><p>The general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, Jan Shortt, says the potential pitfalls with the new system \"should have been much better thought through\".<p><p>\"Even if you've got a mobile phone, you've still got no electricity and you need to make sure your phone can be charged,\" she said.<p><p>\"There are an awful lot of people across this country that don't know about this new system coming in.\"<p><p>Which? quoted a survey earlier this year which found 91% of UK adults did not know the digital switchover was coming and some have been transferred without appreciating what was happening.<p><p>Some, like Mr Round, say they were not given a choice.<p><p>Others, like Ms McLean, say they were not warned the new system would fail in a power cut nor were they offered the battery back-up as recommended by Ofcom for those in so-called mobile \"not spots\".<p><p>Mr Round was offered a battery but was told it would cost him £85. However, when he agreed to pay he was told they were out of stock.<p><p>The batteries are only free to people living in \"not spots\" prone to power cuts. Those, like Mr Round, who normally have mobile reception are not eligible.<p><p>BT says there is a global shortage of the back-up units and it will not move anyone who needs one onto VOIP until it can access more. It also says it makes it clear power cuts will render broadband landlines unusable.<p><p>For those who are offered back-up battery, there is the separate issue of how long it lasts.<p><p>Ofcom guidance is 24 hours on standby and one hour of talk time. But, in the regulator's report on protecting access to emergency services during a power cut, London Fire Brigade and the Communications Consumer Panel argued for a longer minimum talk time. The Joint Radio Company noted an emergency could occur far longer than an hour after the initial outage.<p><p>Speaking on the BBC's You and Yours in September, Lindsey Fussell from Ofcom said \"an hour is about right because we know that the vast majority of power cuts in the UK last considerably less than an hour\".<p><p>She did add that, in parts of the country where people typically have much longer power cuts, landline providers would have to offer a different solution, such as a longer-life battery.<p><p>However, the batteries are seen as a last resort. Both Ofcom and BT regard mobiles as the preferred back-up.<p><p>The regulator says its research shows 100% of households should be able to receive at least a 2G signal (the minimum needed to call 999) from at least one operator.<p><p>An emergency call will go through whichever network has reception, it says.<p><p>But Storm Arwen proved mobiles can also be vulnerable in extreme conditions.<p><p>Masts in areas like Westgate in County Durham and Rothbury in Northumberland failed, leaving people unable to make any calls at all - despite an Ofcom requirement that everyone should be able to call 999.<p><p>One resident from Grizedale in the Lake District, who did not want to be named, said she struggled with weak phone signal \"at the best of times\". This was knocked out by the power cut, as was the wi-fi she uses to boost it.<p><p>\"There was absolutely no signal in the whole of the valley for three or four days, and I couldn't drive up the hill to get one because the roads were all closed,\" she says.<p><p>Regular power cuts make it difficult for her to live and run a business when the communications system relies on electricity. \"It's embarrassing that a supposedly world-leading country has such a shonky infrastructure,\" she says.<p><p>\"I had full 4G in the mountains of Transylvania a few years ago.\"<p><p>Westmorland and Lonsdale MP Tim Farron says having no phone at all is \"very dangerous for lots of people\".<p><p>\"Putting all your eggs in one basket isn't a good idea,\" the former Lib Dem leader says.<p><p>\"If the power goes out and if you have no means of charging a phone then you're in trouble.\"<p><p>In Rothbury, Northumberland, three mobile masts serving EE, Vodafone and O2 all failed in Storm Arwen.<p><p>Steven Bridgett, the county councillor for the area, asks: \"Why don't those masts have back-up generators?\"<p><p>EE said it was deploying generators where it could and was \"working with power companies to restore power\" as soon as possible. Vodafone and O2 have been approached for comment.<p><p>BT says \"very few people\" would have no mobile reception and Ofcom did not expect providers to \"predict and provide solutions for all exceptional circumstances\".<p><p>When asked about those who were unable to make even 999 calls, a BT spokesperson said the damage caused by Storm Arwen had been \"unprecedented and no phone or broadband provider could come up with a solution that would allow backup services to work for more than several days\".<p><p>However, Ofcom says it recognises there may be exceptional circumstances where a normal level of service is not possible but \"even in those circumstances, our rules are clear that there should be protections in place for people to call the emergency services\".<p><p>Customers should be provided with \"solutions that are appropriate for their needs\", including greater protection for those living in an area \"subject to regular power outages longer than an hour\".<p><p>A spokesperson said the regulator was \"in touch with BT to understand how they are meeting these obligations to these customers\".<p><p>However, the obligation to provide 999 connectivity does not extend to a right to make any type of calls, such as to a power company or friend.<p><p>There is an irony, spotted by Mr Bridgett, that the green agenda is not taking into account the realities of weather associated with climate change.<p><p>Electric cars, air source heat pumps and the new digital landlines are all \"useless in circumstances like this\", he says. \"The whole thing's an absolute joke in the aftermath of a storm like that.\"<p><p>He wants resilience built into utility infrastructure by the organisations responsible for it.<p><p>\"That's what they're there for and what people pay their bills for.\"<p><p>Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
